Unreleased
----------

Fixed
^^^^^
- validators.validate_dateimte_asutc now properly raises a ValueError if the provided
  tz-aware datetime has a non-UTC tz offset (before any tz-aware datetime would pass
  the validator).


0.6.0 (2023-09-25)
------------------

Changed the concept of primarily recording PDS-like "products" in the database and data
structures, and changed the concept to capture "records" of various kinds (ImageRecords,
LightRecords, and derived things like PanoRecords) in the database and as the primary
data unit for use and interaction.  And then PDS "products" will be made at a later
time via a process that sources one or many records.

Added
^^^^^
- image_records.py (this replaces the concept of raw_products.py)
- create_image.py (this replaces most of the functionality of the previous
  create_raw.py)
- image_tags.py which contains image tag information.
- image_requests.py defines the table for holding image requests.
- Junction tables to connect LDST information to ImageRequests and ImageTags
  to ImageRecords.
- ldst.py table which contains LDST information.
- light_records.py which handles information about luminaire state.
- anaglyph.py
- pano_check.py to sort through image records and figure out what would be a good
  panorama set.

Changed
^^^^^^^
- header.pga_gain_dict structure now has values that are always floats, which helps
  to determine whether this transformation needs to be applied.
- image_stats.py is the new raw_stats.py, supporting ImageRecord objects.
- pano_products.py is now pano_records.py, supporting ImageRecord objects.
- create_pano.py now supports ImageRecords and PanoRecords.
- create_raw.py rearchitected to gather information from "records" to build XML PDS
  labels.
- create_vis_dbs entry point changed to vis_create_dbs to conform with other vis-related
  entry points.
- pid.VISID now properly sorts the uncompressed "z" state lower (better) than the
  lossless compressed "a" state.
- pid.VISID now has a best_compression() function to sort out the best compression state
  from an iterable containing may compression states from a single observation.


0.5.0 (2023-07-26)
------------------

Added
^^^^^
- PanoID class added to pds.pid
- pano_products and create_pano added, still very preliminary, mostly just mock-ups.
- colorforge program for managing colormaps.
- mypy is now in the development dependencies to support type checking.
- lint/mypy target added to Makefile.
- tri2gpkg now has a --remove_facets option to remove facets with a particular value.


Changed
^^^^^^^
- Explicit in documentation about developing in Python 3.8 (although earlier versions
  should still be supported).
- Many changes to improve type checking.
- Added numeric instrument aliases and checking for them.
- Added information for procesingInfo and outputMask from Yamcs.
- Upgrade to SQLAlchemy >=2.
- Moved definition of Base class up to vis.db.
- heatmaps.py will now accept value data lists or arrays with np.nan or None values
  which will be appropriate ignored in the density heatmap calculation.


Fixed
^^^^^
- tri2gpkg - if the provided polygons have zero area, issue an error rather than
  making a confusing GeoPackage file.



0.4.0 (2023-03-01)
------------------

Added
^^^^^
- carto.bounds module added to unify functionality for both heatmaps and dotmaps.
- carto.dotmap module for creating simple heatmap-like visualizations from 2d scalar data.
- Makefile now has a "lint/twine" option to hopefully help me remember to test that.
- VIS image_statistics.py and raw_stats.py modules.
- A variety of unit tests.
- mypy configuration arguments.

Changed
^^^^^^^
- Flattened test directory structure.
- tri2gpkg -v is no longer an alias for --value-names, as it now determines verbosity
  since logging has been added.
- GitHub workflows have been re-arranged.  Black and flake8 are now run under the "Lint"
  action, and the flake8 tests are removed from the Python testing matrix.

Removed
^^^^^^^
- The pinned versions requirements_dev.txt

Fixed
^^^^^
- CHANGELOG.rst had an unescaped underbar which caused trouble with twine upload.
- setup.cfg arrangement in install_requires passed local testing, but not GitHub testing,
  have now fixed.
- heatmap's generate_density_heatmap() function now properly returns values of zero
  in the returned out_count numpy array when there are no counts in those grid cells
  instead of the provided nodata value.
- tri2gpkg now works correctly if --keep_z is specified
- tri2gpkg now uses the correct srs if a pre-defined site is selected.


0.3.0 (2022-11-15)
------------------

Added
^^^^^
- pds.datetime.fromisozformat() function.
- pds.pid.VISID.compression_class() function.
- pds.xml.py added, very minimal, functionality may be moved.
- vis.db.raw_products.RawProduct.from_xml() function.
- vis.db.raw_products.RawProduct.asdict() function.
- vis.pds.create_raw.check_bit_depth() function.
- vis.db.create_vis_dbs convenience program to add empty tables to database.

Changed
^^^^^^^
- Updated templates and modules for PDS information model 18.
- vis.db.raw_products.RawProduct has some improved error-checking in __init__() and
  validate_datetime_asutc().
- vis.db.raw_products.RawProduct product_id column is now unique in database.
- vis.db.raw_products.RawProduct md5_checksum changed to file_md4_checksum to
  clearly associate it with the other properties that begin with "file\_".
- vis.pds.create_raw.tiff_info() no longer raises an error if a bit depth other than 16
  is provided.
- vis.pds.create_raw now creates .JSON output files by default instead of XML PDS4
  labels, but XML files can still be made.
- carto.heatmap.write_geotiff_rasterio now supports compressed output and defaults to "deflate"


Fixed
^^^^^
- carto.tri2gpkg.replace_with() now correctly returns a float value in all circumstances.
- pds.pid.VIPERID.datetime() now properly returns datetimes with a UTC timezone.
- vis.db.raw_products.RawProduct.label_dict() now correctly sets sample_bits and
  sample_bit_mask if the image is a SLoG image.
- Added __init__.py files to all modules (some modules did not get incorporated into the
  PyPI package because they did not have __init__.py files.
- The setup.cfg now properly includes requirements that vipersci needs.

Removed
^^^^^^^
- Many modules still had if __name__ == "__main__" constructs from early development
  which are now not needed with the entry points in setup.cfg.


0.2.0 (2022-11-07)
------------------

Added
^^^^^
- Data Simulators for NSS, NIRVSS, and MSolo
- Lots of material to enaable PDS archiving of VIS data.
- Added GitHub workflow to perform Black format checking

Changed
^^^^^^^
- Many updates to heatmap.py
- Applied Black formatting to all code in the repo.
- Modified Python testing workflow to actually work.


0.1.0 (2022-10-05)
------------------
Initial release.
