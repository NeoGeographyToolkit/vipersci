This vipersci package is software to support the activities of the
Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) Science Team.

This software will implement scientific models to convert instrument
raw data to useful derived data (but not including any proprietary
instrument details). This includes functionality for running the
models "in reverse" in order to simulate instrument data for tests
and mission simulations. This software will enable and support the
creation of various geospatial data sets (maps) to help visualize
and understand data from the spacecraft. It will also support the
creation of PDS4 archive labels and structures for eventual data
delivery to the Planetary Data System (PDS).

At the moment, this repo is under significant development and change as we
attempt to craft various pieces of code.  It is definitely a work-in-progress.

The VIPER Science Team is developing this software "in the open"
in order to adhere to the new `NASA Science Information Policy for
the Science Mission Directorate (SPD-41)
<https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf>`_
as much as is possible.
